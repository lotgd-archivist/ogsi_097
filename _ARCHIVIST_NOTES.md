## About this version

This is the source code from https://logd.ogsi.it/s1/logd/, an italian translation of the game with heavy modifications.

The files in this repository were obtained through a publicly available archive located on the ogsi.it servers.

I could not determine if that sharing of code was intentional, but I could determine that the archive file was publicly available for at least 3 years before I obtained a copy. I contacted the server owners (with the help of someone who speaks italian), but got no answer.

In the end, I decided that since the code was shared publicly and for a long time - and given the license of logd 0.9.7 - it was okay for me to publish this archive. It is still unfortunate that I could not get explicit permission.

The files were originally timestamped 2014-08-30.
I obtained the archive on 2022-03-19.

## Redactions

I removed some images that looked like automatically generated banners for forum signatures. These had no import to the code and contained some player data, so I removed them.

I also removed 3 skins / templates that I were reasonably sure were incompatible with the GPLv2, as they related to other intellectual property.
